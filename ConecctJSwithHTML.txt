until now we were usign the console 
to write the code, but in real life, developers use web apps that have html css and js
html is the one that executes the css

CONECCT JS WITH HTML

in html we can white <script> 
all inside of this label is JS

TO CONNECT

<script src="./script.js"> </script>

in the same label but changing src whit the rute
NOW JS CAN READ HTML
....................................................................









READING HTML FROM JS

the is more ways


	QUIERYSELECTOR

this function is  same that declare a label in css

const h1 = document.querySelector("h1")

1 : create an variable
2 = document.querySelector
3 = etiquet that we want to select
	class 		.clase
	id    		#ids
	header     	defect labels

that is only to create vars with html elements
we can do anything with this vars


IN CONSOLE
all elements of HTML have a lot of propities, one of INPUT is 
	value
that saves the string that is writing in this
.
if we write something in the INPUT
WE CAN SEE THIS USING THE SELECTOR
	
	console.log(input.value)

and it shows us the value that it will saving



QUERYSELECTORALL

SELECTS ALL ETIQUETS WITH THE SAME NAME
the adove only selects the first one it finds
-------------------------------------------------------------






THERE IS MORE SELECTORS LIKE:

getElementsByTagName("li")   etquet
getElementsByClassName("card")	class
getElementsByName("nombre")	atribute
getElementsById("menu")		id

querySelector("a")	element "only first"
querySelectorAll("a")	element "all"
querySelector(".card")	class
querySelector("#card")		id
querySelectorAll(".card")[2]	clase,[number of position]
querySelector(".menu li")	anidador


.



















TRUCO
WITH CONSOLE.LOG
write the vars that we can log() in object form

console.log({
    h1,
    p,
    .parrafin
    #ids
})
